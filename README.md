# Linalgkit

## Presentation

Whoever that study something related with science, and specially those fills that have strong mathematical basis (physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics its self, ...), have to deal with __Linear Algebra__ (LA) someday. This is an enormous field that covers from all the methods that resolves systems of equations, to the description of algebraic structures called _vector spaces_ and the transformations that can be defined there. In my personal case, two things happen to start creating a project about this topic:

1. I learned Python and mostly work with the Numpy package for college purposes.
2. I learned LA and ended up liking it a lot (yeah, another freak to this world).

So... __why not combine this two things__ on a single __package__ that implements the common tools needed in LA!! -- That's what I thought.

This is what this package is about: __to simply create understandable function and tools for LA__ in Python. The other intention is not just give the package with the code itself, but to give a deep explanation about the thinking followed and the building process between the algorithms. This is something that I rarely find on the documentation and code of other people, even from the fully-documented Numpy package. On the other hand, many books and documents that focus on the numerical methods in LA do not contrast the this algorithms with the ones found on internet. 

I tried to introduce the functions of the lialgkit package in a course-like manner. In the wiki[] of this repository you can find a chapter-section structure, each one introducing the context of a certain LA problem. In each section, I have tried to exemplify mostly everything that is written in the package code, so that anyone can be surprised about what is written there because it would be the same code as the examples. I think of this as a very mathematical approach, taking concrete examples and then generalize the result found: in our case, resolving an LA problem in Python code and then implementing the abstract funcion or method.
